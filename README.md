# maple 🥞

maple is a learning platform for Brooklyn College Computer Science students. I noticed a gap between what students know
in their programming classes compared to what they are expected to know. maple will host useful resources for students to build
their skills. 

Rather than contrived toy puzzles designed to confuse you, maple phrases its questions in the easiest way.

The program uses React and Typescript. I plan to implement Monaco Editor with a Judge0 backend soon.
