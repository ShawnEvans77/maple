        Welcome to maple! This is a resource for <a href=https://www.brooklyn.edu/">Brooklyn College</a> computer science students to practice course material. 
        This is just a hobby, it won't be big and professional like Leetcode.

            Abstract
        </h2
        <p>
            I am working on this platform in an effort to help Brooklyn College computer science students improve their grades.
            There has been a gap between what students know compared to what they are expected to know. This platform's primary purpose will be to alleviate this problem.
