            Welcome to maple! This is a resource for <a href=https://www.brooklyn.edu/">Brooklyn College</a> computer science students to practice course material. 
        </p>

        <p>This is just a hobby, it won't be big and professional like Leetcode.</p>

        <h2>
            Abstract
        </h2>

        <p>
            I am working on this platform in an effort to help Brooklyn College computer science students improve their grades.
            There has been a gap between what students know compared to what they are expected to know. 
            This platform's primary purpose will be to alleviate this problem. maple hosts real problems that improve your fundementals as opposed to contrived toy puzzles. 
        </p>

        <h2>
            Offerings
        </h2>

        This platform will contain material such as the following:

        <ol>
            
            <li>Python Problem Sets</li>
            <li>Java Problem Sets</li>
            <li>C++ Problem Sets</li>
            <li>Real Brooklyn College CISC Exam Questions</li>
            
        </ol>

        <h2>
            Prepare Better
        </h2>

        <p>
            I want this to be a better way to prepare for exams compared to dated practice exams with obfuscated solutions.
            Use this as one of many resources to become a cracked developer capable of solving the world's hardest problems.
